Numba is one of the powerful packages in python. Here(i.e in Python) numba package contains number of decorators which when we use in normal python programs, the speed of program increases incredablly. Numba is mostly used for the array-oriented functions. For instance, the time required to perform sum of elements in the array is 250 slower than using a Numba decorator in the program. Litrally we need to add a single line of code to the program i.e decorator, this results in time consumpsion. Parallization is an added advantage here in numba, where the task is divided into chunks and been performed by a multi-proccesor system(if exists). This feature is simmilar to processing big data, where task is divided into chunks and disributed over the cluster of nodes and those nodes accomplish the assigned task.
